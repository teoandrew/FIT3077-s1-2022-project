### Project Scope

The scope of this project was to create a functional Covid-19 booking system. 

There would be two main groups of people that would be using the system, namely customers and Covid-19 facility staff members.

Customers would be able to:
  - login to the system to save their booking history
  - book a **physical test** at a facility of choice 
  - book a **home surveillance testing** (where they would test themselves with a facility member supervising the self-test process. The development of the home surveillance system is outside the scope of this project)
  - modify/cancel their bookings
  - search testing sites

Facility staff members would be able to:
  - login to the system as a staff member
  - book testing appointments on behalf of customers
  - view all bookings made for their respective facilities through an admin interface

### Project Purpose

The purpose of the project is to familiarise students with the different software architecture models currently in-use such as Model-View-Controller (MVC) through implementing it. Students were also given the opportunity to use various design patterns such as Factory Methods, Abstract Factories, Observers, and Fa√ßades. 

Students were also given exposure to using APIs and storing information using JSON. The API in use for the project was Monash University's own Monash Web Service API.
